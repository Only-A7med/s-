HOW TO RUN ON DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS:

If you cannot launch the Steam (.exe) version of Epic Battle Fantasy 5 for whatever reason, a Flash version (.swf) is included.
Run the Windows, Mac or Linux Flashplayer, and use it to open "Epic Battle Fantasy.swf".
Alternatively, you may also be able to open "Epic Battle Fantasy.swf" in a web browser, or even on a mobile device that can run Flash content.

The Flash version is exactly the same as the Steam version, but Steam features will not work, including: 
achievements, cloud saving, the exit button, and different fullscreen resolutions.

You can use the save backup feature to transfer save data between the two versions.

NPC MAKER:

There's a bonus game-dev tool included. You can open "NPC maker.swf" with Flashplayer, and make your own NPCs.

ABOUT THE SAVING SYSTEM:

EBF5 uses .meow files to save your data. These are found in the installation folder, and Steam Cloud should sync these between machines.
You can also use the save backup system to easily transfer saves to other machines, or other versions of the game. 
These backup files include your achivements.

ABOUT PERFORMANCE:

The hardware requirements for this game are higher than would be expected.
It mainly uses the CPU to render vector graphics - lowering the resolution and anti-aliasing will make a huge difference.
Disabling idle animations and screen shake will also make a big difference.
If your native resolution is higher than 1080p, I strongly recommend changing it to something smaller, before using the "Best Fit" fullscreen mode.

The game should run on pretty much any hardware, but possibly very slowly.

MISC:

There's some goodies in the "wallpapers" folder.
